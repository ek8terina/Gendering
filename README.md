# Gendering
This is a repository to get predicted gender from named entities with a first name, second name, and surname. This code gets the gender prediction from Gender API, NamSor, Genderize.io, and Gender R Package and combines all gender predictions to get the best possible prediction between all four services. Final result agglomerates output from all four sources.
